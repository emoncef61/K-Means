# K-Means
This Python code implements the K-Means clustering algorithm using the KMeansClustering class. K-Means is a fundamental unsupervised machine learning algorithm for clustering data points into 'k' distinct groups based on similarity.

Key Features:

The code defines a KMeansClustering class with an option to specify the number of clusters (k) when initializing.
It uses the Euclidean distance metric to determine data point assignments to centroids.
The algorithm iteratively optimizes cluster centroids until convergence.
The code demonstrates the algorithm's functionality by clustering randomly generated data points and visualizing the results with matplotlib.
